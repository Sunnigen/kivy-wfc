## Current Progress 11/19/2021
Finally solved my propagation issue! Watching these tiles resolve is pretty **mesmerizing**.

## Next Steps
Now a proof of concept exists, i'm going to define a project plan to make this a module for other developers to feed their own input and use within their existing apps.
## Inspiration
My understand of WFC comes from a paper I read from [Isaac Karth](https://procedural-generation.isaackarth.com/2019/03/05/wavefunctioncollapse-and-you-i-recently-put.html).
## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Sunnigen/kivy-wfc.git
cd kivy-wfc
main.py
```
Note: There are other tilesets that are packaged. Press the **Load Tileset** button.
